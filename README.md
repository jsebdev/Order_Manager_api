# Order Manager api

This is the back end side of an app that handles the process of handling orders for a fictional retail company.

It uses JWT with flask to make the user authentication.

In order to use this api, you'll need to do it using the [front-end](https://github.com/Sebas93cay/Order_Manager_frontend) or the [deployed version](https://sebas93cay.github.io/Order_Manager_frontend)
